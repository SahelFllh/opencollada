Requirements:
-------------
To build the COLLADAMaya plug-in you need a installed version of Autodesk Maya, 
including the SDK, installed.

Supported versions are:
Autodesk Maya 2008

You also need a c++ compiler. The current Project was build with 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. You can find the visual studio project file in 
the COLLADAMaya directory ./scripts.


Build:
---------
Before you can start to build you have to define the environment variable 
"MAYA_LOCATION" to your installation path of Autodesk Maya.

Download and compile the sources of COLLADAMaya. Copy the generated file 
"COLLADAMaya.mll" into the folder /bin/plug-ins of your Autodesk Maya 
installation.
You can also define a environment variable "MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH" and put the 
generated mll-file into the pointed directory.

Start:
--------
When you start Autodesk Maya, go to the menu 
    << Window >>, 
        << Settings/Preferences >>, 
            << Plug-in Manager >>
and load the plug-in "COLLADAMaya.mll" from the extended list.

Now you can export your maya scene in a COLLADA file.
