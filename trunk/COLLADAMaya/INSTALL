Requirements:
-------------
To run the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need a version of Autodesk Maya installed.

Supported versions are:
Autodesk Maya 2008

To run the binary you have to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 
Redistributable Package (x86). You can download and install it from:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=32bc1bee-a3f9-4c13-9c99-220b62a191ee&displaylang=en

For help on build, please read the BUILD file.

Install:
--------
On build with MS Visual Studio, the required plugin files will be copied into 
your Autodesk Maya directories.

If you install the binary, you have to copy following files:
- "COLLADAMaya.mll" into $(MAYA_PATH2008)/bin/plug-ins directory 
- "colladaNextGenExporterOpts.mel" into $(MAYA_PATH2008)\scripts\others directory 

You can also define a environment variable "MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH" and put the 
mll-file into the refered directory. Autodesk Maya will load the plug-ins 
from this directory too.

Execute:
--------
When you start Autodesk Maya, go to the menu 
	Window > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager
and load the plug-in "COLLADAMaya.mll" from the extended list.
Now you can export your maya scene into a COLLADA file.

Maya plugin loader bug:
-----------------------
Maya error: "Failed to find COLLADA exporter"
It's a known bug that sometimes some versions maya don't recongnoize the last 
converter on the list. To fix this, load a exra plugin after the fact and it 
should work.
