Requirements:
-------------
To build the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need following installations:
-	Autodesk Maya, including the SDK
- 	Boost C++ libraries

Supported versions of Autodesk Maya are:
-	Autodesk Maya 2008

Supported and tested versions of boost c++ libraries:
-	Boost 1.35
-	Boost 1.36

You can download the latest version of boost from:
http://www.boost.org/users/download/

You also need a c++ compiler. The Project was build and tested with: 
-	For Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and the VC2005 Platform SDK. 
	You find the MVS solution file in ~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/COLLADAMaya.sln, 
	respectively the MVS project file in 
	~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/scripts/COLLADAMaya.vcproj
- 	For OSMac: XCode 
	You can find the XCode project file in 
	~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/COLLADAMaya.xcodeproj

The project's build is tested for: win32, x64, mac.

Build:
------
Before you start to build, you have to define following environment 
variables for a win32, respectively a x64 system: 

win32:
-	"MAYA_PATH2008" to your installation path of Autodesk Maya
	The include directory of maya has to be "$(MAYA_PATH2008)\include"
	The lib directory of maya has to be "$(MAYA_PATH2008)\lib"
-	"BOOST_ROOT" to your installation path of boost
	The boost include directory has to be "$(BOOST_ROOT)"
	The lib directory of boost has to be "$(BOOST_ROOT)\stage\lib"
	
x64:
-	"MAYA_PATH2008_X64" to your installation path of Autodesk Maya
	The include directory of maya has to be "$(MAYA_PATH2008_X64)\include"
	The lib directory of maya has to be "$(MAYA_PATH2008_X64)\lib"
-	"BOOST_ROOT" to your installation path of boost
	The boost include directory has to be "$(BOOST_ROOT)"
	The lib directory of boost has to be "$(BOOST_ROOT)\stage64\lib"

Download and compile the sources of COLLADAMaya from
https://colladamaya.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/colladamaya/branches/nextgen.

Open the solution in ~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/COLLADAMaya.sln
The solution configurations "ReleasePlugin2008" and "DebugPlugin2008" will 
create a dynamic library called "COLLADAMaya.mll". The file 
will be created in the output folder and copied into the folder 
$(MAYA_PATH2008)/bin/plug-ins of your Autodesk Maya installation.
If you don't use the MS Visual Studio project file, you have to copy the 
created "COLLADAMaya.mll" file into this directory.

The solution configuration "ReleaseConsole2008" and "DebugConsole2008" create
the "COLLADAMaya.exe" file in the output folder and will be copied into the
"./nextgen/COLLADAMaya/testsuite" folder. If you start the "testAllFiles.bat",
all maya files in the current directory and all sub-directories will be 
converted to collada "dae" files and checked with the coherency checker.

For help on installation, please read the INSTALL_WIN.TXT file.
