Requirements:
-------------
To run the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need a version of Autodesk Maya installed.

Supported versions are:
Autodesk Maya 2008

For help on build, please read the BUILD file.

Install:
---------
On build with the project file of MS Visual Studio, the "COLLADAMaya.mll" file 
will copied into the folder $(MAYA_PATH2008)/bin/plug-ins of your Autodesk 
Maya installation.
If you don't use the MS Visual Studio project file, you have to copy the 
created "COLLADAMaya.mll" file into this directory.

You can also define a environment variable "MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH" and put the 
generated mll-file into the pointed directory. Autodesk Maya will load this
directory too.

Start:
--------
When you start Autodesk Maya, go to the menu 
    << Window >>, 
        << Settings/Preferences >>, 
            << Plug-in Manager >>
and load the plug-in "COLLADAMaya.mll" from the extended list.

Now you can export your maya scene in a COLLADA file.
